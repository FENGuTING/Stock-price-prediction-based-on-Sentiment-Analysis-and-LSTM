Abstract

This project explores stock price prediction by combining social media sentiment analysis and time series models.
It employs two pre-trained Transformer models (FinancialBERT and DistilRoBERTa) for sentiment analysis of financial tweets and integrates the sentiment data with stock price and volume data for prediction.
Traditional machine learning models are used for trend prediction, while Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are used for price prediction. 
Results indicate that DistilRoBERTa outperforms other models in sentiment analysis, and LSTM achieves the best performance in predicting stock opening prices when combined with sentiment features.
